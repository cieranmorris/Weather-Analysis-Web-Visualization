                        <p>Given that wind speed is affected by changes in air pressure in relation to temperature differences in the atmosphere, it makes sense that the southern hemisphere would have a slightly negative assocation with wind speed and latitude. As cities are located closer to the equator the air temperature is naturally higher, so there is less cool air dropping as warm air rises. The further away a city is from the equator the ambient temperature is generally cooler, so as warm air rises there is a greater change in air flow as cool air descends and increases overall wind speed.</p>
