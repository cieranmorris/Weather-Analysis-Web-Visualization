                        <p>For both hemispheres, there seems to be minimal influence or correlations between percent humidity and a city's latitude coordinates. With very low correlation coefficients (less than 0.5) displayed in the linear regression analysis, observing relationships based on temperatures would be more accurate as humidity is dependent on the temperature levels.</p>
