                        <p>When observing cloudiness based on geographical coordinates of each city, there is minimal correlation between the two factors. There are several city coordinates that concentrate at both ends of the cloud cover scale, which may be dependent on other environmental factors such as rainfall, humidity, and precipitation.</p>
