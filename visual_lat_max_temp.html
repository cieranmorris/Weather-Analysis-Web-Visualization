                            <p>There were distinctive differences in the relationship of maximum ambient temperature and latitude coordinates
                                between the northern and southern hemispheres. The northern hemisphere had a defined negative relationship as
                                latitude increased, with the correlation coefficient equaling -1.42, meaning that as the latitude increased and
                                cities were located further away from the equator, the temperatures dropped substantially. This would make sense
                                as this data was collected in February 2021 and the northern hemisphere is in it's winter solstice during that
                                time.</p>
                            <p>The opposite can be observed with the analysis of temperature and latitude in the southern hemisphere, which had a slightly positive relationship with a positive correlation coefficient of 0.28. As the latitude is further away from the equator maximum temperature is lower, however there is a weaker coefficient for the southern hemisphere in February 2021 as it is currently within it's summer solstice so on average the temperatures are higher.</p>
